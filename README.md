## Target Audience

You understand linux servers, nginx, docker and various hosting technologies
and want a tool to help you manage your deployments.  You don't require any
support, take sole responsibility for your uptime, and are interesting in
contributing to this project.

If you're looking for stable, maintenance free hosting backed by a
professional team whose sole purpose is to keep your app running,
you're looking for Galaxy.

This is meant to handle private code. You run your own WMD server for all
your own projects. This is not intended to be cloud-hosted and offer
deployment services to others (which is against the license). PLEASE READ
"IMPORTANT NOTES", BELOW.
